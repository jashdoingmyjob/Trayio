# Trayio
Take home assignment Part 1: Robotic Hoover

## How to run
The robotic hoover program was developed using Python, so you can run the following CLI in terminal:                          						
	```
	python trayio_roomba.py
	```										
This will run the program and use the `input.txt` file that exists in the same directory as an input. 

## Unit Testing
I've also included a file called `trayio_roomba_test.py` which serves as my personal unit test for the program. As clean coding convention, I created the unit tests prior to developing the program (Test Driven Development).

## Output
The output will be printed out to terminal in the same format as the instructions indicated.
